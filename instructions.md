# IPFS Podcasting

Simply run the service to partipate in hosting podcast episodes on the IPFS network. Your node will make periodic requests for "work" to [IPFSPodcasting.net](https://ipfspodcasting.net/). The website will detemine which episodes to load into IPFS and which to remove from IPFS (after they expire).

## Usage

The default usage is anonymous. Anonymous nodes will only host random episodes for a short period.

You can optionally configure an email on your node, and create an account via [IPFSPodcasting.net/Manage](https://ipfspodcasting.net/Manage). With an account you can also "Favorite" feeds to signal that you want to support shows by hosting episodes long term.
