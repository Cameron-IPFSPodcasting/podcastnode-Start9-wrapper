# IPFS Podcasting

Simply run the service to partipate in hosting podcast episodes on the IPFS network. Your node will make periodic requests for "work" to [IPFSPodcasting.net](https://ipfspodcasting.net/). The website will detemine which episodes to load on your node, and which to remove after they expire.

## Usage

The default usage is anonymous. Anonymous nodes will only host random episodes for a short period. You may not see activity until a new podcast episode is released, and you have been randomly selected to host that file.

## Create an Account

You can optionally configure an email (under `Config`), and create an account via [IPFSPodcasting.net/Manage](https://ipfspodcasting.net/Manage). With a website account, you can view your stats and "Favorite" feeds to signal that you want to support shows by hosting long term. 

For example, a [Gold Favorite](https://ipfspodcasting.net/Help/Favorites), will download all episodes for a feed until you un-favorite. This enables fans and friends of a podcast to support the show by crowd hosting it's content.
