# IPFS Podcasting

Simply run the service to partipate in hosting podcast episodes on the IPFS network. Your node will make periodic requests for "work" to [IPFSPodcasting.net](https://ipfspodcasting.net/). The website will detemine which episodes to load into IPFS and which to remove from IPFS (after they expire).

## Usage

The default usage is anonymous. Anonymous nodes will only host random episodes for a short period. You may not see activity until a new podcast episode is released, and you have been randomly selected to host that file.

You can optionally configure an email (under `Config`), and create an account via [IPFSPodcasting.net/Manage](https://ipfspodcasting.net/Manage). With a website account, you can "Favorite" feeds to signal that you want to support shows by hosting episodes long term. For example, a [gold favorite](https://ipfspodcasting.net/Help/Favorites), will download all episodes for a feed until you un-favorite. This enables fans and friends of a podcast to support the show by crowd hosting content.
